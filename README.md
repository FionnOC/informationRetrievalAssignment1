# Information Retrieval Project 1

The aim of this work is to create a Apache Lucene search engine.

The Cranfield Collection, which is a collection of ~1400 documents, is indexed by the code.

â€“ Can be foudn at http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cran/

The search engine is then tested using 225 queries, with different scoring approaches.

To run the code, use the following command

```
sh run_files.sh
```
